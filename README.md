# üî• Pass The Torch: Placement Story Platform

## Project Overview
Pass The Torch is a modern, full-stack application designed to capture, organize, and share detailed placement experiences from seniors to aid juniors in their preparation. It features clean, user-friendly UI and integrates an AI mentor for contextual support.

The application is built using React (Vite) on the frontend, managed by Redux, and uses Appwrite for its backend services (Database, Authentication, and Storage). Crucially, it leverages the Gemini API for context-aware Q&A within each article.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Structured Content & Dual Database Model
- To handle comprehensive placement narratives and avoid database column limits, the content is split into two linked Appwrite collections:
  - **Main Articles Collection**: Stores lightweight, searchable metadata (Student Name, Role, Company, Batch Year, Status).
  - **Article Details Collection (Secondary)**: Stores the large, unstructured text content for each section (postJourney, postStrategy, etc.), linked via the article's unique ID (slug).

### 2. Context-Aware AI Chatbot
- **Purpose**: The chatbot acts as an AI mentor that provides answers strictly based on the content of the currently viewed post.
- **Technology**: Directly integrates the Gemini API via client-side fetch (using necessary environment variables for security).
- **Functionality**: Summarizes sections, elaborates on experiences, and provides fallback responses if info is missing in the article.

### 3. Enhanced UI/UX
- **Home Page**: Sharp, filterable cards with student photos, names, and subtle hover effects.
- **Post Details**: Displays a large circular student photo, key metadata (Name, Role, Dept, Batch), and uses collapsible sections for easy navigation.

### 4. Custom Slug Generation
- **Format**: `[Student Name]-[Department]-[Batch Year]` (e.g., `p-l-hareesh-cse-2025`).

### 5. Additional Features
- Rich Text Editing using **TinyMCE**.  
- Image upload supported via **Appwrite Storage**.  
- Secure Authentication powered by **Appwrite**.  
- **Role-Based Access**:  
  - **All users (juniors + seniors):** Can view posts and access the home page and all posts page.  
  - **Seniors:** Can create accounts to access **Add Post** functionality and edit/delete their posts.  
  - **Juniors:** Can interact with the **AI Q/A chatbot** to ask context-based questions.
